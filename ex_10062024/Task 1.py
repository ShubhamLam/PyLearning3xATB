# 1. Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.

 # = operator is assignment operator, which is used to assign value to variable.
 # == campare operator , it is used to campare value , and we get output in boolean.

# compare operator.
a = 10
b = 20
print(a==b)

#2. What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?

# ** operator is used to find out power of any value it is a exponentiation operator
# for ex: 10^2 = 100 , (10**2) = 100

c = 2
d = 2
print(c**d)

#3 What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?
#The ^ operator in Python is a bitwise XOR operator.
#It follows XOR table. It compares the each bit of the first operand to the respective second operand.
#ie If one bit is 1 and other bit is 0 , it returns 1.

a=5
b=3
print(a^b)
